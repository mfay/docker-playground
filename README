This is a simple example of a load balanced system using Docker and Docker Compose.  The system uses haproxy, nodejs (express), and redis.  Redis is used to keep session state across the load balanced webservers.

Build the webserver image with the following command:
docker-compose build

This will create the image for the webserver.  You will need to run this any time changes are made to the web application source code.

Start the system with the following command:
docker-compose up -d

Scale up the number of web servers to 5 with the following command:
docker-compose scale web=5
