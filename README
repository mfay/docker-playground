This is a simple example of a load balanced system using Docker and Docker Compose.  The system uses haproxy, nodejs (express), and redis.  Redis is used to keep session state across the load balanced webservers.

Start the system with the following command:
docker-compose up -d

Scale up the number of web servers to 5 with the following command:
docker-compose scale web=5
